# About
> This is a repository where I am apllying to Gamers Club Data Analystic Test. Here I am going to show how I UP the database, how I analysed the charts using python, show the results (more charts) and discuss about it. In this repo I am trying to understand why much people leave the Game course after watch a few classes and look for a way to solve this.  
The database credentials has been omitted.
